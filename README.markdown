# FFT Processing in JUCE

This is the source code for my blog post [FFT Processing in JUCE](https://audiodev.blog/fft-processing/).

It shows a simple example of how to use the short-time Fourier transform (STFT) in a plug-in to process audio data in the frequency domain and convert it back to the waveform domain.
